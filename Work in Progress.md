## Work In Progress

---

The Work In Progress page lists the features that are scheduled to appear in future releases of the Su Doku Solver. No particular significance should be attached to the order in which the features are listed.

Further work on the project has been made possible by the kind contributions of the [project donors](donors.htm).

---

### Documentation

The documentation has to be improved dramatically - particularly with respect to the more obscure pattern types such as Nishio and Swordfish.

---

### GUI Resize

The applet GUI struggles to display a 4x4 grid correctly. The GUI should be redesigned - perhaps with Swing - so that all common grid sizes are displayed comfortably.

---

### Reinstatement of the Shuffle button

I removed the Shuffle button from Release 1.18 as the GUI had started to look cramped and I felt the Shuffle to be the most expendable button of those that remained. I have received a user request to reinstate the button, so it will be restored as soon as I have reworked the GUI to create more space.

---

### Swordfish description

Precise references to the cells that make up Swordfish and X-Wing patterns should appear in the Reasoning Area.

---

### Script notation

It would be useful to be able to enter puzzles in some sort of script notation driven purely by the numeric keypad. This would make it far easier to enter puzzles from the papers.

---

### To solve the Dion Cube

The 3D Dion cube is described on the [Daily Telegraph](http://www.sudoku.org.uk) website. Clearly, it calls for a brand new interface, at the very least.

---

### Dancing Links

I'd like to investigate the claim that the Dancing Links algorithm devised by Donald Knuth will solve Su Doku puzzles efficiently.

---

### Systems of Linear Equations

It's possible to describe the Su Doku puzzle as a system of linear integer equations in the variables d[i,j,v], which take the value 1 or 0 depending on whether the cell (i,j) contains the value v. I'm not sure whether it's possible to solve the necessarily large system of equations efficiently.

---

### Composer GUI

The Composer app now has enough options to justify a GUI to assist the user.

### Samurai Su Doku

The Times dated May 28 2005 introduces Samurai Su Doku, a large Su Doku puzzle constructed from five intersecting standard puzzles.
