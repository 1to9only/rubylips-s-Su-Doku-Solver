**Su Doku Solver** - from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sudoku/<br>
**Previously** - Brought to you by: rubylips

A Java project to solve the Sudoku puzzles (see http://www.sudoku.com) [dead link] that appear daily in most newspapers.
The solver applet, which explains exactly how it arrives at its solution, is hosted at http://act365.com/sudoku. [dead link]

The project was last updated 2005-11-03 - it now appears abandoned.
The source code is in a old CVS repository, and SourceForge discontinued support for CVS as of November 30th, 2017.
I can no longer find any working tools to import the CVS repository (with history) into Git,
and I don't want to spend more time looking into this!

This repository is my best import attempt (with no history).

I have also converted the .htm files at http://sudoku.sourceforge.net/ to .md (Markdown) format.
These are for reference only.
I've done some reformatting, the text is mostly asis, so beware some dead links!
