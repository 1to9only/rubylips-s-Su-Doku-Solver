### Grading

The puzzles, all of which are solvable by logic alone, are graded according to the toughest pattern to appear.

* **Easy** - A single candidate exists for each move.
* **Medium** - A Single Sector Candidates pattern is involved.
* **Hard** - A Disjoint Subsets pattern is involved.
* **X-Wings** - An X-Wings pattern is involved.
* **Swordfish** - A Swordfish pattern is involved.
* **Nishio** - A Nishio pattern is involved.

The Pappocom software will label Swordfish and Nishio puzzles 'Arguably Unfair'. I would agree that Nishio puzzles are arguably unfair - however, it seems a trifle harsh to apply this label to Swordfish puzzles.

The following books are available for download:

Microsoft does its bit to make the download procedure more complicated than it might be:

* Right-click on the link and select 'Save Target As'.
* Change the directory name in the file dialogue box to the Pappocom library directory, typically `C:\Program Files\Pappocom\Sudoku\Library`.
* Change the file extension from `.xml` to `.sudbook`.
